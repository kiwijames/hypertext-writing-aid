This program is for my master thesis.
The starting point gave the template of the pdftron Viewer. (license to be checked)

TODOS:
 - check last_modified of docs
 - allow the user to decide which link to follow (thus support when multiple annoations of same)
 - allow user to decide to open new document on same-document-link
 - generalise link making with buttons in menu

 TO DISCUSS in theory:
 - import file by url
 - share links
 - save arrangement
