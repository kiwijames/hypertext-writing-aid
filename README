This program is for my master thesis.
The starting point gave the template of the pdftron Viewer. (license to be checked)

TODOS:
 - allow the user to decide which link to follow (thus support when multiple annoations of same)
 - allow user to decide to open new document on same-document-link
 - document id/name mapping for name-changes or missing docs

 TODISCUSS:
 - import file by url
 - share links
 - save arrangement

user experience:
 - on startup select default path of documents or so
 - check if document moved but same name, ask user?
