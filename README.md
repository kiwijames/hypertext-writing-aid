# Hypertext-Writing-Aid
> This program was developed as a prototype for a master thesis that explored bidirectional span-level linking as a scientific writing aid.

Hypertext-Writing-Aid's (HWA) main focus is the ability to link text of PDFs to each other and a simple included text editor. With this the user can not just highlight or annotate PDF documents, but can make connections between them.
